## Jasper

This is a port of Ghost's default theme [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) for Jekyll inspired by [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper).

You might well ask at this point why bother making a new Casper's clone?
Although this is inspired by Kasper, there are several **additional** features which make this port closer
to the original theme. This port is based on the last Casper v1.3.7 (same as v1.4.0 that runs in Ghost 1.0).
